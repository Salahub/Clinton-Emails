# Clinton-Emails
There are two code files included in this repository. They are described below.

## EmailFunctions.R
This displays the email extraction and download functions, as well as a 
number of the early explorations into the data. All preprocessing used code to
generate the data to be used in the app is found here, along with some code
which represented early attempts at data display and analysis.

## app.R
As it sounds, this contains the code to display the data in a shiny app in R.
